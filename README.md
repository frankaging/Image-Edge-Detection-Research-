Edge detection
Write a Matlab function E = cannyEdge(I)
Compute the Canny edges. Canny edges are defined as local maxima of the image gradient. Following the steps described in the lecture notes:
(a) compute gradient magnitude and orientation,
(b) seek local maximum in the gradient orientation
(c) continue search in the edge orientation of detected edge point
